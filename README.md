- Hi, I’m luke! I’m interested in spaceflight & rockets, robotics design and microcontrollers.
- I’m currently learning intergrating computer vision onto hardware, and more algorithms.
- Outside of embedded and sometimes web development, I play the electric guitar or create cool models to 3D print.
